"""X402 payment middleware for Bindu.

This module provides x402 payment protocol enforcement middleware
for agents that require payment for execution.

The X402Middleware automatically handles:
- Payment requirement detection
- Payment verification with Coinbase facilitator
- Payment settlement after successful execution
- 402 Payment Required responses

Payment session endpoints are available in bindu.server.endpoints.payment_sessions:
- POST /api/start-payment-session: Start a new payment session
- GET /payment-capture: Browser page to capture payment
- GET /api/payment-status/{session_id}: Get payment status and token
